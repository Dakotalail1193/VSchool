                    The Orc race originated on the planet Draenor. A peaceful people wit shamanic beliefs, they were enslaved bythe Burning Legion and forced into war with the humans of Azeroth.
                    Althought it took them many years, the Orcs finally escaped the Demons' corruption and won thier freedom.
                    To this day they fight for honor in a alien world that hates and reviles them.
