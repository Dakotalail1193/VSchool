                    Ten thousand years ago, the Night Elves founded a fast empire, but their reckless use of primal magic brought them to ruin.
                    In grief, they withdrew to the forest and remained isolated there until the return of their ancient enemy, the Burning Legion. 
                    With no other choice, the Night Elves emerged at last from their seclusion to fight for their place in the new world.
