                    Once at home in the jungles of Strangletorn Vale, the firece trolls of the Darkspear tribe were pushed out by warring factions.
                    Eventually the trolls befriended the Orcish Horde, and Thrall, the young Orc Warchief, convinced the Trolls to travel with him to Kalimdor.
                    Though they cling to thier shadowy heritage, the Darkspear Trolls hold a place of honor in the Horde.
